    # Blade classes, you can constrain installation of a given package
    # to only the Virtual Blades that are instances of those
    # classes. It is not recommended to do this to the packages listed
    # in the base configuration because those are explicitly used by
    # the platform layer, but this may be usefull for things used,
    # perhaps, by a given cluster or application layer.
